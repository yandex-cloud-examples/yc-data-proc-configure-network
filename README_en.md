# Configuring networks for Yandex Data Processing

You can create a [Yandex Data Processing](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-proc) with preconfigured subnets and NAT gateway. See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/data-proc/tutorials/configure-network) to learn how to set up the network infrastructure, along with the one for Yandex Data Processing, through Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [data-proc-nat-gateway.tf](data-proc-nat-gateway.tf).
